# 2-Mini-Project

Try to setup a page with boxes that size and layer on different size screens.

Failed - had to bring in code from class solved folder so i can play around with it try and help me understand it better.  This project is not my code it is a combination of class instruction and my changes to try and teach me the layout.

Need to work on this more in future projects.
